    <h1> An overview of my recent projects</h1>
    <ul><li><b>AIFSB : AI for Sports Betting</b></li><u>Descriptive :</u> An AI-based program that seeks for profitable betting strategies. This project, which I developed from scratch, is capable of identifying possible <i>value bets</i> in various sports and leagues. During the first 2 months of exploitation - brutally stopped by the Covid-19 pandemic -, betting on these selected bets yielded a Return On Investment (ROI) of 7.42% over 694 games, allowing me to earn a 4-digits amount, after starting from a 250 euros capital.<br/>

    <li><b>scrapeOP : A python package for scraping oddsportal.com </b></li><u>Descriptive :</u> This pip package provides the user a set of tools to scrape the great oddsportal.com database. As the original site is quite difficult to scrape (website architecture and data formats), a bit of time is required to develop such tools. <br/>

    <li><b>scrapeVIN : A python package for scraping vinted.fr</b></li><u>Descriptive :</u> This pip package provides the user a set of tools to scrape vinted on a daily basis. The user can create a set of requests and criteria for which the code will look for on the website, and then sending the current available products via mail (mail part in development). The code has even been adopted for scraping foreign versions of the website : USA, UK, Germany, and multiple european countries. <br/>

    <li><b>Studying the GSE 47541 dataset : comparing the effects of antidepressants with drugs</b></li><u>Descriptive :</u> As part of the <i>Data Analysis and Exploration</i> course followed at the University of Trento, this report summarizes the work produced along the four-months period and contains questioning results concerning the wide prescription of such medication. This project was single-handed and I achieved to obtain a top grade of 30/30 (Master I level of education) <br/>

    <li><b>ANC_box : Implementing Active Noise Control in a simple module [In Development]</b></li><u>Descriptive :</u> Creating a small box that can capture and analyze environment sounds, in order to create and emit a counter signal to attenuate the noise. This could be useful to counter city noises such as traffic jam, audio pollution or even bird noises in the morning. ANC is already present in multiple working fields impacted by noises (aeronautic, open-spaces, construction sites) but there is currently no solutions for individuals. <br/>
